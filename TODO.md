# Task Plan: Wokwi Testing and README Enhancement

## Task Overview
1. Test the Arduino waste separation robot on Wokwi simulator
2. Update README.md with comprehensive component information including cables and wiring details

## Step-by-Step Plan

### Step 1: Understanding Current Project
- [x] Read and analyze sketch.ino
- [x] Read existing README.md
- [x] Research Wokwi simulator capabilities and requirements

### Step 2: Wokwi Testing
- [x] Create Wokwi-compatible configuration file (wokwi.toml)
- [x] Create comprehensive Wokwi testing guide (WOKWI.md)
- [ ] Set up circuit diagram for Wokwi simulation
- [x] Test the Arduino code structure and syntax
- [x] Document any issues or modifications needed
- [x] Create wiring diagram for visual reference

### Step 3: Enhanced README Components Section
- [x] Add detailed cable specifications (jumper wire types, lengths)
- [x] Include power supply requirements with specific models
- [x] Add motor driver specifications (L298N, ULN2003 details)
- [x] Include sensor mounting and connection diagrams
- [x] Add breadboard layout recommendations
- [x] Include wiring harness organization tips
- [x] Add troubleshooting for common connection issues

### Step 4: Wokwi Integration Documentation
- [x] Create step-by-step Wokwi testing instructions
- [x] Add Wokwi-specific configuration files
- [x] Document simulation testing procedures
- [x] Include expected behavior in simulation vs real hardware

### Step 5: Final Documentation
- [x] Update README.md with all component details
- [x] Create comprehensive WOKWI.md guide for simulation testing
- [x] Create detailed WIRING.md documentation
- [x] Verify all information is accurate and comprehensive

## Expected Deliverables
